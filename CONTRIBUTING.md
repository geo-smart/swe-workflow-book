## Contributing website changes

To build our website, we need specific Python packages which are managed with the `conda` and `mamba` tools. If you already do not already have those tools installed, we recommend using the [Mambaforge Installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge):


1. Fork this geosmart's website repo on GitHub.

1. Clone your fork locally:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/geo-smart/use_case_template.git
    cd book
    ```

1. Create a branch to add your changes:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

1. Create and activate the "geosmart" conda environment.

   __NOTE__: If you're running linux or Windows use `conda/conda-linux-64.lock.yml`
    ```sh
    mamba env create --name geosmart --file conda/conda-osx-64.lock.yml
    mamba activate geosmart
    ```
   __NOTE__: If you want to add packages or change the environment,
    you must follow the procedure outlined in [./conda/README.md](./conda/README.md).

1. Make your desired changes and build the book locally

    ```sh
    jb build book
    ```
   __NOTE__: to preview the changes open `book/build/html/index.html`

1. Push your branch to GitHub when you're ready:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

1. Open a pull request through the GitHub website: https://github.com/geo-smart/use_case_template
